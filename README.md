# sift

A fast and powerful open source alternative to grep.


## Features

sift has a slightly different focus than most other grep alternatives. Code search, log search / digital forensics and data processing are the main use cases, but the primary goal is to provide safe defaults and to make it easily configurable for a specific use case. Among the features are:

* Stable releases, cross platform support
* Safe defaults: sift searches everywhere if not configured otherwise
* Complete & working .gitignore support
* High [performance](https://sift-tool.org/performance) for many uses cases
* Support for adding custom file types to narrow down searches
* Multiline support
* Support for big files: >50GB, >5,000,000,000 lines and >5,000,000,000 matches successfully tested

Sift allows easy customization.
Example: Configure sift to
* Ignore case
* Show line numbers
* Skip binary files
* Respect .gitignore files:

```sift -i -n --binary-skip --git --write-config```

The configuration can be overridden for specific directories.

sift understands **conditions** to process complex formats or support code audits.

Example: Search for ```.php``` files containing a call to mysql_query, that is preceded by ```$_GET``` or ```$_POST``` (accessing external input), but the preceding 5 lines do not contain a call to an escape function:

```sift -x php mysql_query --preceded-within "5:_(GET|POST)" --not-preceded-within "5:escape"```
